# Covid-Detection-Lung-Xrays
2021/2022 sem 1 - Image Processing Individual Assignment Project - Covid detection with Lung X-rays images - Detect Covid or other diseases based on Lung X-rays images by using transfer learning of CNN.


For this project I used feature extraction from Transfer Learning, which I import the pretrained CNN model such as Resnet50, VGG16 and Inception and change the last layer to suit my need. The model can achieve a F1-score of 0.88 by using VGG16, which is the best among other pretrained model.
